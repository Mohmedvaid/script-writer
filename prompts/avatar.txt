════════ WHAT TO DELIVER ════════
ONE     AVATAR BLOCK

──────────────── AVATAR BLOCK ────────────────
If the same figure appears in several scenes, create one **Avatar** description first.  
Give:

• NAME & ROLE      – one line (e.g., “You – weary lamp-lighter”)  
• FULL LOOK        – head-to-toe clothing, colours, age, posture  
• FACE DETAILS     – hair, eyes, expression (soft, neutral)  
• KEY PROPS        – items always with them (e.g., dented lantern, thin scarf)
