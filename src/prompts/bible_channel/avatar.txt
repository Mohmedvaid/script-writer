You are designing the single recurring avatar for a gripping Bible‑history video.

INPUT OUTLINE  
{{OUTLINE}}

TASK  
• From the outline’s era and spiritual cues, craft one concise human avatar spec (4‑6 lines) that will intrigue viewers and remain visually memorable across chapters.

FORMAT — MUST MATCH EXACTLY (no extra lines, bullets, or markdown):

Name – short, era‑appropriate nickname (e.g., “Eli”, “Mara”, “Abba Joel”)  
Look – garb true to {{SETTING}} (earth‑tone linen, leather sandals, practical layers) and average build / height  
Face – warm, weather‑worn features; steady, inquisitive gaze; neatly trimmed beard if male  
Props – one humble yet instantly recognisable symbol (scroll, shepherd’s staff, clay oil lamp) always included  
Palette – ochre, deep indigo, burnished copper for continuity

RULES  
• Keep it PG‑13; no romantic or graphic details.  
• Zero modern references or slang.  
• Return nothing except the formatted avatar spec.
