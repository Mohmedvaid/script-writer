You are continuing visual‑scene design for a gripping Bible‑history video.

INPUT  
{{CHAPTER_CONTENT}}

TASK  
Generate exactly {{IMAGES_PER_CHAPTER}} image‑cues for THIS chapter only.

FORMAT — MUST MATCH **exactly** (no blank lines, bullets, or extra fields):

#1 SHORT TITLE (3–5 words)  
Scene – one vivid, present‑tense sentence describing what the viewer sees.

#2 SHORT TITLE (3–5 words)  
Scene – …

#3 SHORT TITLE (3–5 words)  
Scene – …

RULES  
• Titles: Capitalise major words; no ending punctuation.  
• Scene line: start with “Scene – ” (en‑dash U+2013); 15–25 words.  
• Mention the recurring avatar briefly when relevant.  
• Tone: reverent, cinematic, curiosity‑driven; no modern slang.  
• Visuals evoke late‑Renaissance ⁄ Baroque oil paintings (rich chiaroscuro, earthy palette, dramatic light).  
• Seed each scene with a striking, era‑plausible detail (rare spice price, quirky census token) to spark intrigue.  
• NO additional headings, bullets, numbering styles, or markdown.  
• Do NOT wrap text; each cue block is two lines exactly.

HARD SAFETY RULES  
• No romantic, suggestive, graphic, or medical content.  
• No explicit violence or gore.  
• Avoid words like “kiss,” “wound,” “blood,” “nude,” “death,” “princess,” “modern weapon.”  
• Depict divine presence symbolically (light, aura) — do not show God’s face.  
• Must be suitable for children, religious education, and general audiences.

Return nothing except the {{IMAGES_PER_CHAPTER}} cue blocks in that format.
