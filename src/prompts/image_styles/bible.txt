{{SCENE}}

Medium & Era  
• High-detail late-Renaissance oil painting on linen canvas, muted varnish patina.

Subject  
• Place {{AVATAR_SNIPPET}} at the compositional focus, supported by any other biblical figures, symbols, or objects named above, forming a reverent tableau that visually teaches the verse or theme.

Visual Style  
• Rich but restrained chiaroscuro for gentle depth.  
• Naturalistic anatomy and drapery; subtle halo glow on holy figures.  
• Palette: deep ultramarine, earthy umber, crimson lake, pale gold highlights.  
• Soft atmospheric haze to evoke divine presence, without modern artifacts.  
• Horizontal 16 : 9 format, uncluttered negative space to keep the eye restful.  
• Facial expressions peaceful, awe-filled, or contemplative; strictly PG-13.

Lighting  
• Diffuse, warm candlelight with faint heavenly rim-light—no stark spotlights.

Output  
• One finished frame that looks freshly photographed from a museum-quality masterwork—no borders, captions, or UI elements.
