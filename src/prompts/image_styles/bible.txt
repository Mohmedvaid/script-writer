{{SCENE}}

Medium & Era  
• High-detail late-Renaissance oil painting on linen canvas, muted varnish patina.

Visual Style  
• Rich but restrained chiaroscuro for gentle depth.  
• Graceful drapery and composed figures in traditional garments.  
• Palette: deep ultramarine, earthy umber, crimson lake, pale gold highlights.  
• Soft atmospheric haze to evoke celestial awe, without modern artifacts.  
• Facial expressions serene, reflective, or observant; strictly PG-rated.

Lighting  
• Diffuse, warm candlelight with faint ambient rim-light—no stark spotlights.

Output  
• One finished frame that looks freshly photographed from a museum-quality masterwork—no borders, captions, or UI elements.
