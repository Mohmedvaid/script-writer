{{SCENE}}

Medium & Era  
• 14th-century illuminated-manuscript panel, tempera and ink on vellum with subtle gold-leaf accents.

Subject  
• Include {{AVATAR_SNIPPET}} plus any other figures or objects mentioned above, arranged in one calm tableau.

Visual Style  
• Flat, stylised bodies; primitive perspective; minimal shading.  
• Bold black ink outlines around all forms.  
• Mineral-pigment palette: ultramarine, verdigris, red lake, yellow ochre—slightly faded.  
• Parchment background with gentle age mottling.  
• **No frames, borders, text, UI, or modern artefacts.**  
• Horizontal 16 : 9 layout, balanced and uncluttered to maintain a restful tone.  
• Expressions serene or gently humorous; strictly PG-13.

Lighting  
• Soft, even scriptorium glow—no harsh shadows, no dramatic chiaroscuro.

Output  
• A single finished panel that looks freshly scanned from a medieval codex.
