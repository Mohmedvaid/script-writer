You are continuing visual-scene design for a bedtime-history video.

INPUT
{{CHAPTER_CONTENT}}

TASK
Generate exactly {{IMAGES_PER_CHAPTER}} image-cues for THIS chapter only.

FORMAT — MUST MATCH **exactly** (no blank lines, bullets, or extra fields):

#1 SHORT TITLE (3–5 words)
Scene – one calm, present-tense sentence describing what the viewer sees.

#2 SHORT TITLE (3–5 words)
Scene – …

#3 SHORT TITLE (3–5 words)
Scene – …

RULES
• Titles: capitalise major words; no ending punctuation.  
• Scene line: start with “Scene – ” (en-dash U+2013); ~15–25 words.  
• Mention the main avatar briefly when relevant.  
• Keep tone whimsical, PG-13, low stakes.  
• NO additional headings, bullets, numbering styles, or markdown.  
• Do NOT wrap text; each cue block is two lines exactly.

Return nothing except the {{IMAGES_PER_CHAPTER}} cue blocks in that format.
